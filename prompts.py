Dear [Patient Name],

This letter contains detailed instructions for your care after your knee replacement surgery.

**Medications:** You have been prescribed medications for pain management and to decrease inflammation. It's important to take them as directed by the physician. Never exceed the recommended dose.

**Physical Therapy:** You will need to start physical therapy as early as a day or two post surgery. It is essential to do this regularly and as advised by your physiotherapist for the best recovery.

**Activity Levels:** You are encouraged to move around but, it is equally important to rest as well. Refrain from heavy lifting or strenuous physical activities.

**Wound Care:** Keep the wound clean and dry. On removing the bandage, clean the wound gently with mild soap and water.

**Follow-ups:** Schedule follow-up appointments as recommended by your surgeon. This is crucial to monitor your recovery process.

**Diet:** Maintain a balanced diet to aid your recovery. Ensure you consume sufficient protein to promote healing.

**Signs of Complications:** If you experience severe pain, redness, swelling, or discharge at the surgical site, or if you have a fever above 100.4Â°F, please reach out immediately.

**Emergency Contact:** In case of unexpected complications, contact your healthcare provider immediately, or visit the nearest emergency department.

Remember, recovery is a process that takes time. Patience, proper care, and adherence to these instructions will help you recover smoothly.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
Physician''' """
